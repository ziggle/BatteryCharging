# Battery Charging Algorithm Comparison Relative to Permanent Capacity Loss Over Time

## Abstract

There is ample evidence supporting charging algorithms that minimize the amount of time that a Lithium-ion battery sits "floats" at voltages $\ge$ 4.1 V. This repo contains my analysis of different charging algorithms reduce the amount of time the battery spends at relatively high voltages.

# Background

# Analysis

## Data

All testing was performed using a Maccor battery tester. I chose to analyze the initial data using Excel and Power Query because my coworkers are familiar with Excel and these tools would allow them to work with my output.
